  description: "## Introduction\n\n### The Hubject Platform\n\nThe goal of the “Hubject B2B Service Platform (HBS)” is to enable the electric mobility market by providing an information and transactional gateway for businesses such as charging infrastructure providers, mobility service providers and vehicle manufacturers.\n\n![Hubject Process](images/hubject_1.png)\n\nThe platform enabler functions include: \n\n- Ensuring the interoperability of the public and semi-public infrastructure by promoting accepted standards  within the network and open business user interfaces to the platform \n- Simplification of authentication and authorization procedures through a trustworthy instance as well as safekeeping of sensitive data through the uncoupling of personal data and anonymous user data \n-\tAutomation of contract-based business relationships between power suppliers, car manufacturers, infrastructure service providers as well as further mobility business partners. \n-\tB2B information service for the realization of advanced services within the areas of energy management, traffic management, vehicle reservations, intelligent charging, car sharing and intermodal mobility\n\n### The Emobility Service Provider (EMP)\nAs an EMP you profit from our solution CONNECT. It allows you to offer EV drivers access to public charging infrastructure across national borders. Your customers will be able to identify any available charging point through our easily recognizable compatibility symbol, the intercharge logo. By getting connected to the intercharge network your customers will be able to use every charge point of all participating CPOs via eRoaming.\n\nFor this purpose, you need to be onboarded to the eRoaming platform HBS (Hubject Brokering System). The HBS functions as an open emobility market place, which creates an open synergetic network that everyone profits from in the end.\n\nIn general, there are two different possibilities to be connected to the HBS as an EMP.\n\n##### Offline EMP: \nThe so called offline EMP has no real-time connection for authorization to the Hubject platform. This means that authentication data for the authorization MUST be sent and stored on the Hubject platform via the eRoamingPushAuthenticationData. The HBS will authorize charging sessions locally on the platform. Nevertheless, there can be a real-time connection for pulling dynamic POI data. Furthermore, the CDRs, resulting from each charging session, will not be directly forwarded to the EMP but will also be stored on the HBS. The EMP can then download these CDRs on demand via the eRoamingGetChargeDetailRecords service.\n\n##### Online EMP:\nThe so called online EMP is fully connected to the HBS via a real-time interface. This means that authorization requests are forwarded to the EMP’s system in real-time. To ensure the online authorization, the EMP MUST implement the holistic authorization web service. Furthermore, the CDRs created for each charging session will be directly forwarded to the EMP’s system. Therefore, online EMP’s MUST implement the eRoamingChargeDetailRecord service.\n### Scope\n\nThe information exchange between Hubject and CPO systems is entirely based on web service communication. This document describes the relevant service interfaces for CPO. The Open InterCharge Protocol (OICP) is the most widely implemented communication standard between EMP and CPO systems.\n\nThe information exchange is, in most cases, based on contractual relationships between EMPs and CPOs. In these cases, Hubject only processes service requests if there is a valid contract for the requested service. How EMPs and CPOs manage their service contracts is out of the scope of this document because the contract management aspects of the platform are used via a GUI-based system component.\n\n### Conventions\n\nThe key words `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `REQUIRED`, `SHALL`, `SHALL NOT`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, `RECOMMENDED`, `MAY` and `OPTIONAL` in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).  \n\n### Overview\n\nThe following diagram gives an overview of all service operation messages that can be exchanged between Hubject and the corresponding EMP, respectively CPO systems.\n\nThe chapter [Services and Operations](02_EMP_Services_and_Operations.asciidoc) introduces the supported web services and the corresponding service operations in detail and defines the messages that will be exchanged between Hubject and partner systems. Chapter [Data Types](03_EMP_Data_Types.asciidoc) specifies the data types of the messages inclueing details the required Data Types. Furthermore, every service is described in detail by a business process diagram, which is part of the appendix.\n\n![Hubject Web Services Diagram](images/web_services.png)\n\n### Release management  \n\nHubject intends to pursue a release frequency; whereby, a new update of the OICP can be done within a time frame of two years with the HBS. The frequency of releases to be expected in the future should however not result in additional implementation complexity for partners, since each new release will lead to a new version of the affected services that will run in parallel to the current service version. Consequently, partners do not need to perform an upgrade with each new release, but will rather have the flexibility to choose which of the available valid service versions they wish to use. Service validity is dependent on the OICP version with which they are released (i.e. service versions available in deprecated OICP versions are only considered invalid and will not be supported by the HBS). Only service versions available in active OICP versions shall be supported. Each OICP version MUST be supported for two years by the HBS. \n\nSee below for an example of the implications of the HBS release management approach (note: the dates and content in the diagram below are strictly meant for explanation purposes only. This is not to be considered as an official communication of release dates):\n\n*NOTE*: \n>_the dates and content in the diagram below are strictly meant for explanation purposes only. This is not to be considered as an official communication of release dates_ \n\n![OICP Versions Release](images/oicp_version_release_example.png)\n\n* Service versions: in this example, assuming the current date is October 15th 2021, only service versions highlighted in green will be supported by the HBS; whereas services highlighted in grey will no longer be supported, since these service versions are only available in deprecated OICP versions (i.e. the OICP versions highlighted in red). Consequently, partners can choose one of 3 valid service versions to implement for “Service A”, and one of 2 valid versions for “Service B” and “Service C”. \n* OICP versions: the OICP versions highlighted in red will not be supported by the HBS assuming the current date is 15th October 2021 since they are old therefore deprecated. Also, as depicted in the above example and in contrast to the HBS release management approach, more than two OICP versions can be supported simultaneously going forward.\n\nAll partners using the HBS `MUST` indicate the OICP version they are currently running in their system (i.e. OICP version being used in the communication with the HBS). On the database level however, the current specifications are to be implemented in all systems, i.e. new mandatory fields should be filled with a value.\n\n### Further Documents\n\nTo enable a fast and efficient connection process between the Hubject Brokering System and Partner Systems, the following online webpage contains further information:\n\n* [*support.hubject.com*](https://support.hubject.com/hc/en-us) – Contains all relevant information regarding the onboarding process and other technical information (e.g. Dynamic Pricing 1.0 - Functional Guide for Service Implementation)\n* [*Release notes from OICP2.2 to OICP2.3*](https://github.com/oicp-moderator/OICP-2.3-Draft/blob/master/Realease_Notes.asciidoc)\n\n### OICP protocol version and service versions\n\nBeginning with OICP 2.1, service endpoints are versioned individually and independent of the OICP version. The table below therefore gives an overview of all web services and their current version within OICP version 2.3.  \n\n|Service |Version     |\n|:---|:---:|\n|eRoamingAuthorization|2.1   |   \n|eRoamingChargeDetailRecord|2.2   |\n|eRoamingAuthenticationData|2.1   |\n|eRoamingReservation|1.1   | \n|eRoamingEVSEData|2.3   | \n|eRoamingEVSEStatus|2.1  | \n|eRoamingDynamicPricing|1.0   | \n|eRoamingChargingNotifications|1.1  | \n\n### Overview of Document Reviews  \n\nThe table below provides an overview of all changes made to this document after its initial publication. The changes documented below affect descriptions provided in this document and are mostly corrections or refinements of the specification details.\n\n|Date of Update |Chapter Updated     | Comments |\n|:---|:---:|:---|\n|15th Septmeber 2020|OICP 2.3   |   Implementation description of the new OICP 2.3  \n\n## Communication paradigms\n### REST\nAll new services to be introduced in the future, beginning with OICP 2.2, will be only available over the REST API. This means SOAP communication cannot be used for all new services introduced with OICP version 2.2 or later. Partners that wish to use these new services will therefore need to implement RESTful APIs for the respective communication with the HBS.\n\nAll web services described below are synchronous.  All service messages exchanged between Hubject and partner systems `MUST` use UTF-8 character encoding.\n\n###\tAvailability\n\nThe Hubject system is set up in a highly available environment. Please check the partner contract for details.\n\n### Error handling\n\nIn case that a partner system cannot be addressed by Hubject, Hubject will monitor the connection error in the service session logging.\n\nEach system must be able to cope with possible connection error scenarios as well as with different strategies to solve inconsistencies.\n\nIn case a partner system does not respond to a request by Hubject within the internally defined period, Hubject will monitor the connection timeout in the service session logging.\n\nGeneral HBS related system errors that `MAY` occur during service processing will be caught. The system will then respond to the service requestor with a default _eRoamingAcknowledgement_ message.\n\n### Status codes\nEach message requires a response message in return (at least an acknowledgement).\n\nMost service response messages contain a “StatusCode” field (e.g. eRoamingAcknowledgement). The node provides a standardized code and status description that can be used to return details about certain process statuses. If, for example, an _eRoamingAuthorizeStart_ request fails, the requested provider can specify why the user cannot be authorized.\n\nCode Type contains an overview of all relevant status codes.\n\nThe different states are standardized in order to make automated status processing possible. Backend systems only have to analyze the provided status code, regardless of the functional status description.\n\nThe StatusCode node additionally contains the optional “_AdditionalInfo_” field. This field can be used to provide individual information or process details that go beyond the standardized description. In case the optional “Description” field is used, the field should contain only defined values.\n\n### Session handling\n\nSome web service operations that are defined in <<02_CPO_Services_and_Operations.adoc,Services and Operations>> together form a functional business process, respectively a functional session.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe operations in _eRoamingAuthorization_ cover a charging session. A charging session can be started with _eRoamingAuthorizeStart_ or _eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteStart_ operations and stopped with the corresponding operations. Energy consumption data can then be sent using the _eRoamingChargeDetailRecord_ operation.\n\nTo be able to relate individual operations to the correct session, Hubject assigns a SessionID to every session after the receipt of an initial request (e.g. _eRoamingAuthorizeStart_). The SessionID is part of the operation response and `MUST` be provided with each subsequent request that belongs to the session. If a request contains a SessionID that was not created by Hubject or one that is not valid, the request receives a negative response and no further process steps are performed.\n\nHubject uses globally unique identifiers (GUID) for SessionID creation. Furthermore, it is possible that partner backend systems use their own session concept. Hubject supports this by offering two (optional) request parameters CPOPartnerSessionID and EMPPartnerSessionID. CPO partner systems can use the CPOPartnerSessionID parameter to send their own session IDs. Hubject will assign the CPOPartnerSessionID to the Hubject SessionID and will add the CPOPartnerSessionID to every operation response so that the CPO partner systems can relate the operations to their own session handling.\n\nNOTE: Regarding eRoaming services, the SessionID will be the leading process identifier.\n\n\n### ProviderIDs and OperatorIDs\n\nMost web service operations require the provision of a ProviderID (EMP) or OperatorID (CPO), depending on whether the operation is requested by EMPs or CPOs. The exact format and examples of these ID’s can be seen in Operator/ProviderID\n\nThe IDs are assigned to a specific partner role and they are cross-market unique. There are two roles: eMobility Service Provider (EMP) and Charge Point Operator (CPO). A partner can have one or both roles. If a partner has both roles, two IDs (ProviderID and OperatorID) will be assigned to the partner. Hubject can identify the role that the partner has regarding the current service session depending on which ID is provided with a service request.\n\n### Security\n\nHubject compares the given Provider- or OperatorID to the partner’s SSL client certificate information with every web service request. This helps Hubject ensures that a partner cannot request operations in the name of another partner by simply sending another partner’s ID. If Hubject detects a mismatch between ProviderID/OperatorID and the client certificate information sent with the request, Hubject will not perform the operation and will respond with the status code 017 “Unauthorized Access”.\n\nThe following process diagram describes the partner identification process. It is performed at the beginning of every web service operation, which is described in this document. Consequently, all process diagrams in the appendix are implicitly preceded by this diagram.\n\n![Security](images/security.png)\n\n### Hub Provider and Hub Operator\n\nPartners that are registered with Hubject have the possibility to bundle sub providers (EMP) or sub operators (CPO) and to act as “hub provider” or “hub operator”. The sub partners ID’s need to be configured with Hubject before they can be used in communicating with Hubject. The following diagram shows the relationships between Hubject, hub partners, and sub partners.\n\n![Hub partners](images/hubpartners.png)\n\nHubject may receive service requests that contain sub partner information, e.g. an EvcoID containing the ProviderID of a sub partner. In such cases - when Hubject does not find the ID within the group of registered partners – Hubject will check whether the corresponding partner is bundled by a registered hub provider or hub operator. If so, the following service process will be conducted on behalf of the hub partner.\n\nNOTE: The web service fields ProviderID and OperatorID `MUST` always provide the ID of the partner communicating directly with Hubject. In case of a hub/sub scenario the fields always provide the ID of the hub partner. Sub partner IDs will only be provided implicitly through EVCO- or EVSEIDs.\n\n*Example:*\n\nThe following diagram shows an example scenario. A hub EMP bundles a sub EMP with the ProviderID “DE*456”. A sub EMP customer wants to charge a vehicle at a CPO’s charging station. The customer identifies themselves via an EvcoID that contains the sub EMP’s ProviderID “DE*456”. Hubject cannot identify “DE*456” within the pool of EMPs that are registered with Hubject. Consequently, Hubject checks whether “DE*456” is bundled by a registered EMP. Hubject identifies the hub EMP and continues the process on behalf of the hub EMP. This means that e.g. an online authorization request or the forwarding of a charge detail record request will be sent to the hub EMP.\n\nIn case you are operating charging stations in different countries, please make sure each EVSE is equipped with the correct country code and the corresponding Operator ID. This Operator ID has to be either a sub-operator ID or your main ID.\n\n![Hub partner diagram](images/hubpartnerdiagram.png)\n\n### Data push operations\n\nHubject offers different operations that allow partners to upload (push) data, e.g. upload of EVSE data by CPOs.\n\nIn order to guarantee data consistency, data push requests that address the same operation `MUST` always be processed sequentially. They `MUST` never be executed in parallel. This means that a partner system `MUST` always wait for the Hubject system’s operation response before initiating the next request.\n\nThe reason for this is that push requests, which are sent in parallel, are also processed in parallel by Hubject. Thus, different requests may overtake each other and change their sequence before Hubject stores the data. This could lead to unintended data conditions.\n\n*Example:*\n\nA CPO sends an EVSE full load with several hundred EVSE records. Shortly after that, the same CPO sends an EVSE full load with only one EVSE record. From the CPO’s point of view, the second request should overwrite the first, resulting in only one valid EVSE record. But probably the second (small) request will overtake the first (big) request. This results in the big request overwriting the small one and with it several hundred valid EVSE records on the Hubject system.\n\n### Time zones\n\nThe time needs to be delivered in the format “complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds” referring to ISO 8601:1988 (E), with a time zone offset in hours and minutes. A time zone offset of \"+hh:mm\" indicates that the date/time uses a local time zone which is \"hh\" hours and \"mm\" minutes ahead of UTC. A time zone offset of \"-hh:mm\" indicates that the date/time uses a local time zone which is \"hh\" hours and \"mm\" minutes behind UTC.\n\n`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD` *e.g. “2014-02-01T15:45:00+02:00”*\n\nwhere:\n\n| Format | Description                                            |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| YYYY   | four-digit-year                                        |\n| MM     | two-digit month (01=January, etc.)                     |\n| DD     | two-digit day of month (01 through 31)T, separator     |\n| hh     | two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed) |\n| mm     | two digits of minute (00 through 59)                   |\n| ss     | two digits seconds (00 through 59)                     |\n| TZD    | time zone designator (+hh:mm or -hh:mm)                |\n\nMessages that are sent to Hubject and that Hubject directly forwards to another partner (e.g. _eRoamingChargeDetailRecord_ from CPO to EMP) will not be changed by Hubject (including time zone specifics).\n\nIt is mandatory for CPO’s to provide date/time values including a time zone offset which refers to the charge point location due to the need for time based charging fees.\n\nIn the OICP 2.3, the HBS will store all date/time values in their original form. Also, the original Date/Time values as received and stored by the HBS will be provided in the response to requests from partner systems.\n\n### Calibration Law for eMobility Market:\n\nThis topic is specifically important for Partners who are operating inside Germany. Calibration Law is applicable to both CPO and EMP.\n\nThis Calibration Law simply states that Customer of EMP should be able to verify the charging sessions with the help of encrypted data generated by hardware of charging station (basically Smart Energy Meter). There are few exceptional cases where this Calibration Law is not applicable.\n\nThere are three objectives of introducing this chapter in this revision of OICP\n\n1. As a roaming platform we should give possibility for CPOs to transfer the Calibration Law relevant data (Separate fields for various parameter) for charging session to EMPs.\n2. EMPs should be able to first know if the charging station (mainly EVSEID) can generate / store / share the Calibration Law compliant data. This data can be provided as a part of POI data. This will help EMPs to create appropriate B2C pricing and logic for creating appropriate invoices. Refer EVSE Data section (provide the link)\n3. Long term solution for EMPs should be to automate the pre-checking of Calibration Law relevant data for charging session. This can be easily achieved if EMP has all the Calibration Law relevant data available in Charge Detail Record as separate fields. This will eventually provide a more transparent way of transmitting the data from CPOs to EMPs. Currently with older revision of OICP, CPOs are providing this data in the form of url in Charge Detail Record as “Metering Signature” field. Refer CDR section.\n\n## Appendix\n### Business Process Diagram eRoamingAuthorization\n![Business Process Diagram eRoamingAuthorization](images/eroamingauthorization.png)\n\n### Business Process Diagram eRoamingAuthorization Remote\n![Business Process Diagram eRoamingAuthorization Remote](images/eroamingauthorizationremote.png)\n\n### Business Process Diagram eRoaming Reservation\n![Business Process Diagram eRoaming Reservation](images/eroamingreservation.png)\n\n### Business Process Diagram eRoamingAuthorization GetCDRs\n![Business Process Diagram eRoamingAuthorization GetCDRs GetCDRs](images/eroaminggetcdrs.png)\n\n### Business Process Diagram eRoamingEVSEData\n![Business Process Diagram eRoamingEVSEData](images/eroamingevsedata.png)\n\n### Business Process Diagram eRoamingEVSEStatus\n![Business Process Diagram eRoamingEVSEStatus](images/eroamingevsestatus.png)\n\n### Business Process Diagram eRoaming ChargingNotification Start\n![Business Process Diagram eRoaming ChargingNotification Start](images/chargingnotificationstart.png)\n\n### Business Process Diagram eRoaming ChargingNotification Progress\n![Business Process Diagram eRoaming ChargingNotification Progress](images/chargingnotificationprogress.png)\n\n### Business Process Diagram eRoaming ChargingNotification End\n![Business Process Diagram eRoaming ChargingNotification End](images/chargingnotificationend.png)\n\n### Business Process Diagram eRoaming ChargingNotification Error\n![Business Process Diagram eRoaming ChargingNotification Error](images/chargingnotificationerror.png)\n\n## Glossary and Abbreviations\nCharging Station - The unit where an electric vehicle is charged.

  - name: eRoamingAuthenticationData
    description: |
      This service is only offered by Hubject.

      In addition to the online authorization service that requests customer authentication data on demand from the connected partner systems, Hubject offers the possibility to upload authentication data.

      If an EMP uploads their data to Hubject, Hubject can authorize requests from other partners (e.g. CPOs) without having to forward the request to the EMP. The eRoamingPushAuthenticationData operation gives EMPs the possibility to upload (push) authentication data to the HBS.

      Furthermore, Hub EMPs may also push authentication data of sub-EMPs. Hubject does not distinguish between authentication records of hub providers and their related sub providers.

      Hubject offers the possibility to upload and download charging spot (EVSE) data and, thus, to exchange data between different partners.

      See appendix for a detailed business process diagram regarding the EVSE data service.

      The eRoamingPullEVSEData gives the EMPs the possibility to download (pull) EVSE data from partner operators via Hubject. Hub CPOs may also push EVSE data of sub operators. Hubject does not distinguish between EVSE records of hub operators and related sub operators.
  - name: eRoamingEvseStatus
    description: |
      Hubject offers the possibility to upload and download dynamic charging spot (EVSE) status information and thus to exchange the data between different partners.

      The eRoamingEvseStatus service offers two operations:

      1. eRoamingPushEvseStatus in order to give CPOs the possibility to upload (push) EvseStatus data

      2. eRoamingPullEvseStatus in order to give EMPs the possibility to download (pull) EVSE status data from partner operators via Hubject

      Hub CPOs may also push EVSE status records of sub operators. Hubject does not distinguish between EvseStatus records of hub operators and related sub operators.
  - name: eRoamingDynamicPricing
    description: |
      Since OICP 2.2, HBS offers the possibility to flexibly or dynamically price Authorization services. The service mainly enables pushing (upload) and pulling (download) of pricing data to and from the HBS through webservice requests and/or downloads/uploads in the Hubject portal.

      Flexible pricing enables CPOs to offer differentiated pricing (in multiple currencies) of charging processes at their charging stations. The differentiation of prices can be done along relevant dimensions such as charging facility characteristics (e.g. maximum charging power), EVSE location and time. OICP 2.2 and OICP 2.3 offers the possibility to exchange this flexible price differentiation over webservice communication between CPOs and EMPs.

      In addition to the above flexible pricing capability, OICP 2.2 and OICP 2.3 enables more frequent and near real-time update and exchange of pricing information between CPOs and EMPs. This is achieved whereby a CPO continuously pushes valid prices to the HBS for specific EMPs to pull these prices.

      With OICP 2.2 and OICP 2.3 , the HBS offers an extensive breadth of technical capabilities for flexible and dynamic pricing of charging services for CPOs. Please refer to the supplementary document [“Dynamic Pricing - Functional Guide for Service Implementation”](https://support.hubject.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002042838-Introduction-to-Flexible-Dynamic-Pricing) for more details and a holistic view (technical and business perspectives) of how to best capitalize on the capabilities offered by the eRoamingDynamicPricing service.

      The eRoamingDynamicPricing service offers four operations, namely the:
      1. eRoamingPushPricingProductData operation which gives CPOs the possibility to upload (push) pricing product information. Pricing products refer to the different tariffs offered by a CPO based on the differentiation dimensions mentioned above.
      2. eRoamingPushEVSEPricing operation which gives CPOs the possibility to assign their various pricing products to individual EVSEs and thereby upload (push) location/EVSE-specific pricing data.
      3. eRoamingPullPricingProductData operation which gives EMPs the possibility to download (pull) pricing product information uploaded by a CPO for the respective EMP.
      4. eRoamingPullEVSEPricing operation which gives EMPs the possibility to download (pull) location/EVSE-specific pricing data uploaded by CPOs for the respective EMP.

        __Functional Description:__

        Scenario:

        A customer of an EMP wants to charge a vehicle at a charging point of a CPO. The customer authenticates at the charging point. The CPO’s operator system does not recognize the customer’s authentication data. In order to authorize the charging process, the CPO’s system can send an eRoamingAuthorizeStart request to Hubject. The request MUST contain the OperatorID and the identification data (e.g. UID or EvcoID) and MAY contain the EvseID.

        Hubject generates a SessionID for the charging process and persists important session data (SessionID, EvseID, identification data).

        Regarding the further service processing, there are three different options:

        a. Hubject first tries to authorize the customer offline by checking authentication master data. Authentication data can be uploaded by EMPs using the eRoamingAuthenticationData service.
        ![Authorize Start offline diagram](images/authorizestart_offline.png)

        b. In case offline authorization is not possible, Hubject tries to derive the EMP from the provided identification data. QR Code and Plug&Charge identification data contain the EvcoID. Hubject can derive the EMP’s ProviderID from the EvcoID. Hubject will directly forward eRoamingAuthorizeStart requests to the EMP. The EMP provider system checks the requested authentication data and responds accordingly, either by authorizing or not authorizing the request. The response `MUST` contain the ProviderID and the AuthorizationStatus and `MAY` contain a list of identification data that is authorized to stop the charging process. In case that the EMP provider system cannot be addressed (e.g. due to technical problems), the corresponding provider will be dealt with as if responding “NotAuthorized”.
        ![Authorize evco diagram](images/authorize_evco.png)

        c. In case that Hubject cannot derive the EMP from the identification data (e.g. with RFID identification), Hubject identifies all EMPs that are under contract with the CPO (EMPs must be the service subscriber) and forwards the eRoamingAuthorizeStart request to all these EMPs (broadcast). Hubject consolidates all EMP responses and creates an overall response, authorizing the request in case that one EMP authorized the request.

        ![Authorize Start online diagram](images/authorizestart_online.png)

        In case that the request for authorization was not successful, Hubject deletes the corresponding SessionID for the charging process.

        The response from Hubject to the CPO contains authorization details and in case of successful authorization the created SessionID and the ProviderID of the authorizing provider.

        eRoamingAuthorizeStop basically works in a similar way to the operation eRoamingAuthorizeStart.
        The request is sent in order to authorize the stopping of a charging process.
        The request `MUST` contain the SessionID that was created by Hubject after the initial eRoamingAuthorizeStart request.
        In most cases, Hubject can derive the EMP that authorized the charging process from the SessionID and can directly and offline authorize the request or forward the request for stopping to the EMP.
        In case the charging session was originally authorized offline by the HBS, the session `MUST` only be stopped with the same medium, which was used for starting the session

        The service that is offered by Hubject in order to allow customers to directly start a charging process via mobile app.

        ![Remote start diagram](images/remotestart.png)


        __Functional Description:__

        __Scenario:__

        A customer of an EMP wants to charge a vehicle at a charging station of a CPO. The customer informs his EMP of his intention, e.g. via mobile phone or smart phone application. The EMP’s provider system can then initiate a charging process at the CPO’s charging station by sending an eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteStart request to Hubject. The request `MUST` contain the ProviderID and the EvseID.

        Hubject will derive the CPO’s OperatorID from the EvseID.

        Hubject will check whether there is a valid contract between the two partners for the service (EMP must be the subscriber). If so, Hubject continues with checking the charging point compatibility. In case that the CPO has uploaded at least one charging point data record, Hubject will check whether the requested EvseID is among the uploaded data. If not, Hubject will respond with the status code 603 “Unknown EvseID”. If yes, Hubject will check whether the charging spot’s property “IsHubjectCompatible” is set “true”. If the property is false, Hubject will respond with the status code 604 “EvseID is not Hubject compatible”.

        In case that the requested EvseID is compatible or the CPO has not uploaded any EVSE records at all, Hubject generates a SessionID for the following process and forwards the request (including the SessionID) to the CPO. The CPO `MUST` return an eRoamingAcknowledgement message that `MUST` contain the result indicating whether the charging process will be started and that `MAY` contain a status code for further information.

        In case that the CPO’s system cannot be addressed (e.g. due to technical problems), Hubject will return to the requestor a “false” result and a message indicating the connection error.

        Best Practices:
          * Please ensure a request run time of under 10 seconds including network roundtrip.

        ![Charge Detail Record diagram](images/cdr.png)

        __Functional Description:__

        Scenario:

        A customer of an EMP has charged a vehicle at a charging station of a CPO. The charging process was started with an eRoamingAuthorizeStart or an eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteStart operation. The process may have been stopped with an eRoamingAuthorizeStop or an eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteStop operation. A preceding stop request is not a necessary precondition for the processing of an eRoamingChargeDetailRecord request. The CPO’s provider system `MUST` send an eRoamingChargeDetailRecord (CDR) after the end of the charging process in order to inform the EMP of the charging session data (e.g. meter values and consumed energy) and further charging process details.

        Note:

        The CPO `MUST` provide the same SessionID that was assigned to the corresponding charging process. Based on this information Hubject will be able to assign the session data to the correct process.

        Hubject will identify the receiving EMP and will forward the CDR to the corresponding EMP. The EMP `MUST` return an eRoamingAcknowledgement message that `MUST` contain the result indicating whether the session data was received successfully and that `MAY` contain a status code for further information.

        Hubject will accept only one CDR per SessionID.

        In addition to forwarding the CDR to the EMP, Hubject also stores the CDR. In case that the recipient provider’s system cannot be addressed (e.g. due to technical problems), Hubject will nevertheless return to the requestor a positive result provided that storing the CDR was successful.

        ![Get Charge Detail Records diagram](images/getcdr.png)

        The operation allows EMPs to download CDRs that have been sent to Hubject by partner CPOs. This means if for example Hubject was unable to forward a CDR from a CPO to an EMP due to technical problems in the EMP’s backend, the EMP will still have the option of obtaining these CDRs. The EMP `MUST` specify a date range in the request. Hubject will return a list of all CDRs received by the HBS within the specified date range for the requesting EMP (i.e. all CDRs within the date range where the corresponding charging process was authorized by the EMP or authorized by Hubject based on the EMP’s authentication data.

        Hubject does not check whether a requested CDR has already been provided to the requesting EMP in the past.

        Pagination:

        Starting from OICP 2.3, eRoaminGetChargeDetailRecords uses pagination. This is an implementation that EMPs `MUST` use in order to divide the amount of ChargeDetailRecords contained in the response of the pull request.

        The parameters of the pagination are given at the end of the end point: `…​?page=0&size=20` where `page` indicates the number of the page for the response and `size` the amount of records to be provided in the response.

        Example:

        Using OICP 2.3 GetChargeDetailRecords endpoint for PROD environment:

        https://service.hubject.com/api/oicp/cdrmgmt/v22/providers/{providerID}/get-charge-detail-records-request?page=0&size=1500

        In the previous request we are telling to provide page __0__ with __1500__ records in it.

        Important

        The default number of records provided in the response are __20__ elements and the maximum number of records possible to obtain per page are __2000__.

          * Implementation: `MANDATORY`

        ![Push authentication data diagram](images/pushauthentificationdata.png)

        When an EMP sends an eRoamingPushAuthenticationData request, Hubject checks whether there is a valid contract between Hubject and the EMP for the service type (Hubject must be the subscriber). If so, the operation allows uploading authentication data to Hubject. Furthermore, it is possible to update authentication data that has been pushed with an earlier operation request. How Hubject handles the transferred data `MUST` be defined in the request field “ActionType”, which offers four options (see below).

        The authentication data to be inserted or updated `MUST` be provided with the “ProviderAuthenticationData” field, which consists of “AuthenticationDataRecord” structures. Hubject keeps a history of all updated and changed data records. Every successful push operation – irrespective of the performed action – leads to a new version of currently valid data records. Furthermore, each operation is logged with the current timestamp. Thus, Hubject can reconstruct the status of authentication data for every point in time in the past.

        __Action types:__

        * __fullLoad:__ The EMP uploads the full set of current authentication data. Hubject does not compare the new data to old (earlier pushed) data. It keeps a history of old data records and handles the newly provided data as valid. In order to allow an easy deletion of all records, it is possible to perform a fullLoad with an empty list of records.

        * __insert:__ The EMP adds further authentication data records to the current set of data. Hubject verifies that the provided data records do not already exist in the currently valid data status. If so, the transaction will be aborted, no data will be inserted, and the request will be answered with an error message. Error details will be provided with the “AdditionalInfo” field.

        * __update:__ The EMP updates data records of the current set of data. Hubject verifies that the provided data records do exist in the currently valid data status. If not, the transaction will be aborted, no data will be updated, and the request will be answered with an error message.

        * __delete:__ The EMP deletes data records of the current set of data.

        __PIN security:__

        The authentication data records that are uploaded to Hubject contain one of the defined identification types. The identification type “QRCodeIdentificationType” contains – besides an “EvcoID” field – a “PIN” field or a “HashedPIN” field (only one of the two options must be provided). For security reasons, Hubject generally does not store PINs in clear text, but always as encrypted hash values. When uploading authentication data to Hubject, the EMPs can directly provide hashed PIN values (using the field “HashedPIN”). In case that the PINs are provided in clear text (field “PIN”), Hubject will generate a hash value for every PIN and will store only the hashes. Hubject by default generates a hash using Bcrypt as a hashing function.

        In case that an EMP provides already hashed PINs, he `MUST` also specify the corresponding hash generation algorithm so that Hubject can reproduce the hash generation when processing a request for authorization. For this reason, the “HashedPIN” field contains detailed information concerning the hash function and the hash salt value (for salted hash functions) that must be used for hash generation.

        __EVCO consistency:__

        EvcoIDs contain the ID of the corresponding EMP. With every data upload operation Hubject checks whether the given EMP’s ProviderID (or Sub-ProviderIDs if necessary) matches every given EvcoID. If not, Hubject refuses the data upload and responds with the status code 019.

        Note:

        The eRoamingPushAuthenticationData operation `MUST` always be used sequentially.

        ![Reservation start diagram](images/reservationstart.png)

        __Functional Description:__

        Scenario:

        A customer of an EMP wants to reserve a charging point of a CPO for a later charging process.
        The customer informs his EMP of his intention, e.g. via mobile phone or smart phone application.
        The EMP’s provider system can then initiate a reservation of the CPO’s charging point by sending an eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteReservationStart request to Hubject.
        The request `MUST` contain the ProviderID and the EvseID.
        The demanded reservation product can be specified using the field PartnerProductID.

        Hubject will derive the CPO’s OperatorID from the EvseID.

        Hubject will check whether there is a valid contract between the two partners for the service Reservation (EMP must be the subscriber). If so, Hubject continues with checking the charging point compatibility. In case that the CPO has uploaded at least one charging point data record, Hubject will check whether the requested EvseID is among the uploaded data. If not, Hubject will respond with the status code 603 “Unknown EvseID”. If yes, Hubject will check whether the charging spot’s property “IsHubjectCompatible” is set “true”. If the property is false, Hubject will respond with the status code 604 “EvseID is not Hubject compatible”.

        In case that the requested EvseID is compatible or the CPO has not uploaded any EVSE records at all, Hubject generates a SessionID for the reservation process and forwards the request (including the SessionID) to the CPO. The CPO MUST return an eRoamingAcknowledgement message that MUST contain the result indicating whether the reservation was successful and that MAY contain a status code for further information.

        In case that the CPO’s system cannot be addressed (e.g. due to technical problems), Hubject will return to the requestor a “false” result and a message indicating the connection error.

        ![Pull evse data diagram](images/pullevsedata.png)

        This operation allows downloading EVSEData from Hubject. When an EMP sends an eRoamingPullEVSEData request, Hubject identifies all currently valid EVSEData records of relevant operators.

        For every EVSE data record Hubject identifies the timestamp of the last update, which has been performed on the record. The timestamp is returned with the attribute “lastUpdate”.

        __Delta pull:__

        As mentioned above, the operation by default returns all currently valid EVSE data records. However, the requesting EMP has the possibility to download only the changes (delta) compared to a certain time in the past. In order to do so, the EMP MUST provide the optional date/time field “LastCall”, indicating his last EVSE pull request. In case that Hubject receives the LastCall parameter, Hubject compares the EVSE records from the time of the last call with the currently valid records. As a result, Hubject assigns the attribute “deltaType” (possible values: insert, update, delete) to every response EVSE data record indicating whether the particular record has been inserted, updated or deleted in the meantime. EVSE data records that have not changed will not be part of the response.

        Note:
        * The delta pull option cannot be combined with radial search, because in some cases this could lead to data inconsistency on the EMP’s side. This is why the API only allows the provision of either the attribute “SearchCenter” or “LastCall”.

        __Pagination:__

        Starting from OICP 2.3, eRoamingPullEvseData uses pagination. This is an implementation that EMPs `MUST` use in order to divide the amount of EvseDataRecords contained in the response of the pull request.

        The parameters of the pagination are given at the end of the end point: `…​?page=0&size=20` where `page` indicates the number of the page for the response and `size` the amount of records to be provided in the response.

        Hubject groups all resulting EVSE status records according to the related CPO. The response structure contains an “EvseStatuses” node that envelopes an “OperatorEVSEStatus” node for every CPO with currently valid and accessible status data records.

          When an EMP sends an eRoamingPullPricingProductData request, Hubject checks whether there is a valid flexible/dynamic pricing business contract (for the service type Authorization) between the EMP and the CPOs whose OperatorIDs are sent in the request. If so, the operation allows the download of pricing product data pushed to the HBS by these CPOs for the requesting EMP. When this request is received from an EMP, currently valid pricing products data available in the HBS for the requesting EMP (and pushed by CPOs whose OperatorIDs are supplied in the request) are grouped by OperatorID and sent in response to the request.

          The operation also allows the use of the LastCall filter. When the LastCall filter is used, only pricing product data changes that have taken place after the date/time value provided in the “LastCall" field of the request are sent to the EMP.

        The ChargingNotification feature enables CPOs to notify EMPs about the end of charge

        The ChargingNotification feature basically increases the transparency between CPO - EMP - End Consumer to the level of each charging session.

        This feature enables CPO to send various notifications during a single Charging Session. These notifications give the details like

        1. When the charging session has started. The CPO can send ChargingNotification of type “Start” to Hubject containing information like ChargingStart, MeterStartValue, EVSEID etc.

        2. Consumed Energy values during the charging process or duration of successful charging process that has lapsed. The CPO can send ChargingNotification of type “Progress” to Hubject containing information like ChargingStart, EventOccurred, ChargingDuration, ConsumedEnergyProgress, EVSEID etc. The frequency between two progress notifications for one charging session should be at least 5 minutes.

        3. When the charging session has ended (because no energy is transmitted anymore). The CPO can send a ChargingNotification of type “End” to Hubject containing information such as ChargingEnd, ConsumedEnergy, EVSEID etc.

        4. Error occurred before charging starts or during charging process or abrupt changing end. The CPO can send a ChargingNotification of type “Error” to Hubject containing information such as ErrorClass, ErrorAdditionalInfo, EVSEID etc.

        Hubject will forward Start, Progress, End and Error notification requests to the EMP. The EMP responds with an eRoamingAcknowledgement. This acknowledgement is then being forwarded to the CPO.

        This feature should cover all the notifications that could happen between Session Start and Session End in future. Each bit of information increases transparency to the customer of EMP.

      description: |
        VSEs may be grouped by using a charging pool id according to emi³ standard definition. The Evse Pool ID MUST match the following structure (the notation corresponds to the augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as defined in RFC5234):
        <Evse Pool ID> = <Country Code> <S> <Spot Operator ID> <S> <ID Type> <Pool ID>

        with:

        <Country Code> = 2 ALPHA ; two character country code according to ISO-3166-1 (Alpha-2-Code).

        <Spot Operator ID> = 3 (ALPHA / DIGIT); three alphanumeric characters.

        <ID Type> = “P”; one character “P” indicating that this ID represents a “Pool”.

        <Pool Instance> = (ALPHA / DIGIT) 1 * 30 ( 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT) [/ <S>] ); between 1 and 31sequence of alphanumeric characters, including additional optional separators. Starts with alphanumeric character referring to a specific Pool in EVSE Operator data system.

        ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A; according to RFC 5234 (7-Bit ASCII).

        DIGIT = %x30-39; according to RFC 5234 (7-Bit ASCII).

        <S> = *1 ( “*” ); optional separator

        An example for a valid Evse Pool ID is “IT*123*P456*AB789” with :

        “IT” indicating Italy,

        “123” representing a particular Spot Operator,

        “P” indicating the Pool, and

        “456*AB789” representing one of its POOL.

        Note

        In contrast to the eMA ID, no check digit is specified for the Evse Pool ID in this document. Alpha characters SHALL be interpreted case insensitively. emi³ strongly recommends that implementations SHOULD - use the separator between Country Code and Spot Operator ID - use the separator between Spot Operator ID and ID type
        This leads to the following regular expression:

        `([A-Za-z]{2}\*?[A-Za-z0-9]{3}\*?P[A-Za-z0-9\*]{1,30})`

        This regular expression is similar to that of the ISO EvseIDType but E is replaced with P to indicate a pool.

      type: object
      description: |
        A customer of EMP Authorizes the charging session at particular charging station (via any means for eg REFID card, Mobile etc). Due to some errors sometime, it is possible that charging does not start or charging process is abruptly stopped or fluctuations in the charging process. It is really important for Customer as well as EMP to know what exactly is happening at the charging process. This notification eventually helps EMPs well informed about the problem occurred with the charging process. This information can be easily passed onto Customer so that he/she can take appropriate action.

        The CPO’s backend system MAY send a ChargingNotification of type “Error” after the CPO gets an information about the error at the charging station. The CPO can transmit one of the ErrorClass defined by Hubject along with the additional information which elaborated the Error.

                  | ------ | ----------- |
                  | START FEE | Can be used in case a fixed fee is charged for the initiation of the charging session. This is a fee charged on top of the main base price defined in the field "PricePerReferenceUnit" for any particular pricing product. |
                  | FIXED FEE | Can be used if a single price is charged irrespective of charging duration or energy consumption (for instance if all sessions are to be charged a single fixed fee). When used, the value set in the field "PricePerReferenceUnit" for the main base price of respective pricing product SHOULD be set to zero. |
                  | PARKING FEE | Can be used in case sessions are to be charged for both parking and charging. When used, it needs to be specified in the corresponding service offer on the HBS Portal when parking applies (e.g. from session start to charging start and charging end to session end or for the entire session duration, or x-minutes after charging end, etc) |
                  | MINIMUM FEE | Can be used in case there is a minimum fee to be paid for all charging sessions. When used, this implies that the eventual price to be paid cannot be less than this minimum fee but can however be a price above/greater than the minimum fee. |
                  | MAXIMUM FEE | Can be used in case there is a maximum fee to be charged for all charging sessions. When used, this implies that the eventual price to be paid cannot be more than this maximum fee but can however be a price below/lower than the maximum fee. |
