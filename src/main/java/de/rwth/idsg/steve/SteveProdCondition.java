/**
 * We might also have used {@link Profile} for registering beans depending on profile,
 * but it only accepts String as value (which is not type safe) and we use enums
 * in {@link ApplicationProfile}. The newer {@link Condition} and {@link Conditional} APIs
 * are more flexible by being programmatic anyway.
 *
 * Typing the String value of the enum is not an option, because it might cause problems
 * in future when we change or refactor something. This is how technical debt starts
 * and then everything falls apart.
